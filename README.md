# DSAIRM
Dynamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling

## Description
DSAIRM is an R package that teach within-host infection dynamics and immune response modeling from a dynamical system perspective. You can explore a variety of simulation models through a graphical user interface, implemented in Shiny. By going through the documentation and instructions of each app, you will learn how models can be used to study within-host and immune response modeling. You can also access and modify all simulations to adapt them to our research needs.

## Getting Started
For a quick introduction to the package and step-by-step instructions on getting started, [see the package tutorial (vignette)](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/articles/DSAIRM.html).

You can also give the package [a quick spin online, without having to install it](https://handelgroup.shinyapps.io/dsairm/). I still recommend you install it for as a regular R package should you decide that you want to use DSAIRM 'for real'.
Note that I only have a free plan for shinyapps.io, where the online version is hosted. If the link fails to work it likely means I reached my maximum monthly allowed capacity. In that case, just go ahead and install the package following the tutorial. It's easy! 


## Further information
* A 'companion' package to this one, called Dynamical Systems Approaches for Infectious Disease Epidemiology (DSAIDE), focuses on models for infectious disease epidemiology (the population level). It has the same structure as DSAIRM. [See the DSAIDE site for more information.](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/index.html)
* I have solutions (in progress) to most of the 'What to do' tasks for the different apps. If you are an instructor using this package as part of a class, email me if you are interested in having access to these solutions.
