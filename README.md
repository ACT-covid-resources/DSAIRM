# DSAIRM
Dynamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling

## Description
DSAIRM is an R package containing a set of simulations (apps) that teach within-host infection dynamics and immune response modeling from a dynamical system perspective. By exploring the models through a grahpical user interface and working through the instructions provided for each app, you can learn some important concepts of within-host and immmune response modeling. You will also learn how models can be used to study such concepts.

## Getting Started
For a quick introduction to the package and step-by-step instructions on getting started, [see the package tutorial (vignette)](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/articles/DSAIRM.html).

## Further information
* A 'companion' package to this one, called Dynamical Systems Approaches for Infectious Disease Epidemiology (DSAIDE), focuses on models for infectious disease epidemiology (the population level). It has the same structure as DSAIRM. [See the DSAIDE site for more information.](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/index.html)
* I have solutions (in progress) to most of the 'What to do' tasks for the different apps. If you are an instructor using this package as part of a class, email me if you are interested in having access to these solutions.

## Citation and Contributors
This R package is developed and maintained by [Andreas Handel](http://handelgroup.uga.edu/). A full list of contributors and a Bibtex entry for the citation [can be found here](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/authors.html).
