## Dynamical Systems Approach to Immmune Response Modeling (DSAIRM) 
##To-do list 

#List of apps to implement


* Basic bacteria/IR model
* basic virus model - including birth/death of cells to do steady state
* HCV model 1 & 2 - PK/PD (turn on and off) and 2 effects on outcome

* Kirschner 2001 TB model?
* LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions




#List of apps to maybe implement
* HCV model 3 & 4 - maybe do, maybe not?
* HIV model 1 & 2 - maybe do, maybe not?
