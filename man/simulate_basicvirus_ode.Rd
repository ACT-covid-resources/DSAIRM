\usage{
simulate_basicvirus_ode(U = 1e+05, I = 0, V = 1, n = 0, dU = 0,
  dI = 1, dV = 2, b = 2e-05, p = 5, g = 1, tstart = 0,
  tfinal = 30, dt = 0.1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{: starting value for Uninfected cells}

\item{I}{: starting value for Infected cells}

\item{V}{: starting value for Virus}

\item{n}{: rate of new uninfected cell replenishment}

\item{dU}{: rate at which uninfected cells die}

\item{dI}{: rate at which infected cells die}

\item{dV}{: rate at which virus is cleared}

\item{b}{: rate at which virus infects cells}

\item{p}{: rate at which infected cells produce virus}

\item{g}{: possible conversion factor for virus units}

\item{tstart}{: Start time of simulation}

\item{tfinal}{: Final time of simulation}

\item{dt}{: Time step}

\item{...}{other arguments for possible pass-through}
}
\value{
The function returns the output as a list.
The time-series from the simulation is returned as a dataframe saved as list element \code{ts}.
The \code{ts} dataframe has one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
}
\description{
A basic virus infection model with 3 compartments
}
\details{
The model includes uninfected and infected target cells, as well as free virus. The processes that are modeled are infection, virus production, uninfected cell birth and death, infected cell and virus death.
This code is based on a dynamical systems model created by the modelbuilder package.
The model is implemented here as a set of ordinary differential equations,
using the deSolve package.

\section{Warning}{
 This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do something nonsensical (e.g. have negative values for parameters), the code will likely abort with an error message.
