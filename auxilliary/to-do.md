## Dynamical Systems Approach to Immmune Response Modeling (DSAIRM) 

#Next steps
* write docs and task tabs for all apps
* work on fitting app, parts seem to not work
* add refs to all models

* write advanced fitting app - (cover simulate and test U8-testing) or bootstrapping U8-boot

* Write up all solutions into the DSAIRMsolutions repository


#List of apps to implement
The basics 
* COMPLETELY DONE Basic bacteria + IR model in discrete and continuous time 
* COMPLETELY DONE Basic virus model - including birth/death of cells to do steady state
* COMPLETELY DONE Virus and IR model

What influences model results
* DONE Model variants for an HIV model - the impact of model formulation (HIV mod 1 and 2)
* DONE U/S and LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions
* DONE stochastic virus model, also run deterministic for comparison

Using models to explore and predict
* DONE Bacteria model with scan over a parameter
* DONE data comparing example - Virus and drug (HCV)
* DONE Fitting to data

Further topics
* DONE PK/PD
* DONE flu drug stochastic evolutionary model - DO TEXT OUTPUT
* Advanced fitting to data

#Further apps that could be implemented
* More complicated HCV PK/PD (SISMID-U4-hcv3/4)
* US using regression instead of correlation (U6-us3)
* bootstrapping for fitting (U8-boot)
* models with memory/dummy compartments (U9-memory)
* discrete-time model with noise (U9-noise)
