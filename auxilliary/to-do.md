## Dynamical Systems Approach to Immmune Response Modeling (DSAIRM) 
##To-do list 

#List of apps to implement


The basics
* Basic bacteria + IR model in discrete and continuous time
* Basic virus model - including birth/death of cells to do steady state
* Model variants for an HIV model

U/S analysis and stochastic
* uncertainty and LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions
* sensitivity and LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions
* stochastic/adaptivetau model

Using data
* data comparing example - HCV
* data fitting example - flu

Specific topics
* PK/PD
* evolutionary model




#List of apps to maybe implement
* HCV model 3 & 4 - maybe do, maybe not?
* HIV model 1 & 2 - maybe do, maybe not?


* Kirschner 2001 TB model?
