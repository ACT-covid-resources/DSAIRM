## Dynamical Systems Approach to Immmune Response Modeling (DSAIRM) 

#Next steps
* add refs to all models

* write stochastic app
* write model variant/formulation app
* debug U/S app
* write docs and task tabs for all apps

#Questions-todo
* Can one make generate_XXX functions non-reactive?


#List of apps to implement
The basics 
* COMPLETELY DONE Basic bacteria + IR model in discrete and continuous time 
* COMPLETELY DONE Basic virus model - including birth/death of cells to do steady state
* COMPLETELY DONE Virus and IR model

Using models to explore and predict
* DONE Bacteria model with scan over a parameter
* DONE data comparing example - Virus and drug (HCV)
* DONE flu drug stochastic evolutionary model - DO TEXT OUTPUT

What influences model results
* Model variants for an HIV model - the impact of model formulation (HIV mod 1 and 2)
* U/S and LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions
* stochastic virus model, also run deterministic for comparison

Further topics
* PK/PD
* Discrete time models with noise
* Fitting to flu data
* ...
