## Dynamical Systems Approach to Immmune Response Modeling (DSAIRM) 

#Next steps
* write docs and task tabs for all apps
* add refs to all models
* Write up all solutions into the DSAIRMsolutions repository

#List of apps to implement
The basics 
* COMPLETELY DONE Basic bacteria + IR model in discrete and continuous time 
* COMPLETELY DONE Basic virus model - including birth/death of cells to do steady state
* COMPLETELY DONE Virus and IR model

Using models to explore and predict
* COMPLETELY DONE Bacteria model with scan over a parameter
* COMPLETELY DONE data comparing example - Virus and drug (HCV)
* COMPLETELY DONE simulating data and fitting to it


What influences model results
* COMPLETELY DONE Model variants - the impact of model formulation 
* COMPLETELY DONE U/S and LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions
* COMPLETELY DONE stochastic virus model, also run deterministic for comparison

Fitting Topics
* COMPLETELY DONE, add bootstrap ref - bootstrapping for fitting 
* DONE, no TASKS yet - fitting to do model comparison

Further topics
* DONE, no TASKS yet - PK/PD
* DONE, no TASKS yet - flu drug stochastic evolutionary model - DO TEXT OUTPUT


#Further apps that could be implemented
* More complicated HCV PK/PD (SISMID-U4-3/4)
* US using regression instead of correlation (U6-us3)
* models with memory/dummy compartments (U9-memory)
* discrete-time model with noise (U9-noise)
* fitting of multiple datasets and types of data, e.g. Pawelek 2016 model
* fitting of multiple-condition datasets, e.g. with and without drug present (find old R code for this) 
* fitting using different likelihood approaches (instead of just SSR)
