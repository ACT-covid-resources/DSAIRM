## Dynamical Systems Approach to Immmune Response Modeling (DSAIRM) 
## To-do list 


#Next steps
* Continue on plot generation function: implement legends/on-off, implement boxplot, further additions
* update text output generation functions to work for US app 

* make sure both existing apps and output functions work robustly, then implement the nex app

* Can one make generate_XXX functions non-reactive?


#List of apps to implement


The basics (SISMID U2 models)
1. Basic bacteria + IR model in discrete and continuous time
2. Basic virus model - including birth/death of cells to do steady state
3. Virus and IR model

What influences model results
3. Model variants for an HIV model - the impact of model formulation (HIV mod 1 and 2)
4. U/S and LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions
5. stochastic/adaptivetau model

Using models to explore and predict
* Demo model (SISMID U6-model)
7. Kirschner 2001 TB model
8. Handel flu evolutionary model

Using models with data
* data comparing example - HCV
* data fitting example - flu

Further topics
* PK/PD
* Discrete time models with noise
