## Dynamical Systems Approach to Immmune Response Modeling (DSAIRM) 
## To-do list 


#Next steps
* Write HCV model app
* Write flu drug resistance app
* write model variant app
* get plotting to work on all apps


* Continue on plot generation function: implement legends/on-off, implement boxplot, further additions
* update text output generation functions to work for US app 
* make sure both existing apps and output functions work robustly, then implement the nex app
* Can one make generate_XXX functions non-reactive?


#List of apps to implement


The basics 
* Basic bacteria + IR model in discrete and continuous time
* Basic virus model - including birth/death of cells to do steady state
* Virus and IR model

Using models to explore and predict
* Bacteria model with scan over a parameter
* flu drug stochastic evolutionary model
* data comparing example - HCV

What influences model results
* Model variants for an HIV model - the impact of model formulation (HIV mod 1 and 2)
* U/S and LHS with basic bacteria model - provide ranges for parameters and distributions
* stochastic virus model, also run deterministic for comparison

Further topics
* PK/PD
* Discrete time models with noise
* Fitting to flu data
* ...
