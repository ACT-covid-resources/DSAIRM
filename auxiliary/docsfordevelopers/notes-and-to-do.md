# To-do list for DSAIRM package

## Code Improvements
* Continue implementing unit tests using the testthat package
* Provide a 'download scenario' button, which downloads code that reproduces a given scenario.
* Add checks to parameter settings, don't allow unreasonable (e.g. negative) ones
* Continue streamlining code base to make it more general/modular/flexible
* Fix/finish plot function edits (see code in generate_ggplot)
* Make sure Latex equations work well when floating task list

## Content Improvement
* Write/update all solutions
* Add learning objectives to each overview tab
* Implement further apps, see below
* Clean up and make all model diagrams as nice as possible

## Apps to be implemented
* More complicated HCV PK/PD (SISMID-U4-3/4)
* U/S analysis using regression instead of correlation (U6-us3)
* models with memory/dummy compartments (U9-memory)
* discrete-time model with noise (U9-noise)
* fitting of multiple datasets and types of data, e.g. Pawelek 2016 model
* fitting of multiple-condition datasets, e.g. with and without drug present (find old R code for this) 
* fitting using different likelihood approaches (instead of just SSR)
* co-infection model

## Documentation / Outreach / Advertisement
* Make list of related courses, email instructors
* Create more docs
* Find classes/instructors who could use package.
* Make videos for levels 1/2/3 for packages 


## General thoughts and comments
* look into R consortium package certification
* Get best practices badge: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en
* Maybe submit for Ropensci review: https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding
* Hashtags on twitter when promoting DSAIRM app: #rstats, #dynamicalsystems #immunology #infectiousdisease
