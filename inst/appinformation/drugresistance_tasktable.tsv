"DSAIRM_drugresistance"	"drugresistance"	"Influenza Antivirals and Drug Resistance"	1	"Confirm that you get a single infection with sensitive virus with the default settings. Set 'resistant generation fraction' to a small non-zero value. You should start seeing some resistant virus. Why is it lower than the sensitive virus?"	"T1R1"	"Something"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
"DSAIRM_drugresistance"	"drugresistance"	"Influenza Antivirals and Drug Resistance"	2	"Set 'resistant generation fraction' to 0.01. Run simulation for different drug efficacy values. Observe how the magnitude of the _V~s~_ and _V~r~_ curves change and eventually for high enough drug efficacy, no infection takes place anymore."	"T2R1"	"Something"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
"DSAIRM_drugresistance"	"drugresistance"	"Influenza Antivirals and Drug Resistance"	3	"Set drug efficacy to 0.4, everything else as before. Run simulation for different values of resistant fitness cost. Observe how the magnitude of the _V~s~_ and _V~r~_ curves change. Explore how different values for drug efficacy (which affects _V~s~_) and fitness cost (which affects _V~r~_) lead to different outcomes."	"T3R1"	"Something"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
"DSAIRM_drugresistance"	"drugresistance"	"Influenza Antivirals and Drug Resistance"	4	"Repeat or continue your explorations with more than one stochastic simulation being run."	"T4R1"	"Something"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
