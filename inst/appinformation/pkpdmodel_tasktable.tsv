"DSAIRM_pkpdmodel"	"pkpdmodel"	"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics"	1	"For the first few tasks, we consider an acute viral infection and treatment (e.g. influenza and neuraminidase inhibitor drugs). The model is assumed to run in units of days. Set number of uninfected cells to 10^5^, 10 virions, no infected cells. We make the assumption that on the timescale of an acute infection (several days), the processes of natural, uninfected cell turnover are so slow that they can be ignored. Set values for the uninfected cell birth and death rates to reflect this assumption. Assume that infected cells have an average lifespan of 1 day, virus of 12 hours. Set virus production rate to 10, infection rate to 10^-5^ and conversion factor to 1. Start simulation at time 0 and run for 20 days. For the drug, assume treatment starts at day 10 and occurs daily thereafter at a dose of 1. Assume the drug decays at a rate of 1 per day. Set the concentration-dependent drug effect parameter to 1, the half maximum effect level to 1 and max drug efficacy to 0. Run the simulation. You should get 28694 infected cells at the peak and a max drug dose of 1.57. Since the drug levels are fairly low, you might need to plot the y-axis on a log scale and use plotly and zoom into the drug part to see it's up and down pattern."

"DSAIRM_pkpdmodel"	"pkpdmodel"	"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics"	2	"Since we just had the maximum drug efficacy at 0, the drug had no impact at reducing virus production. Now change to maximum impact by setting this parameter to 1. What do you expect to see? What do you see? You should notice only a small impact, with the final number of uninfected cells having increased a bit.
Now start drug treatment earlier, at days 8, 6, 4, 2, 0. Observe how the drug now has more of an impact. Not surprisingly, the earlier the drug is started, the more of an impact it has. The drug is however not strong enough to suppress the infection. We explore this further next."

"DSAIRM_pkpdmodel"	"pkpdmodel"	"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics"	3	"Let's explore the PK part of the model, i.e. the kinetics of the drug as described by the drug concentration equation. Reset all inputs. Then set maximum drug efficacy to 1, start drug on day 2. Run the model, set the plot engine to plotly with a log y-axis. By reading off the values for the drug from the graph (or looking at the reported values below the graph), convince yourself that the peak drug concentration starts at 1 and slowly over the first few days increases to around 1.5. Now set the drug decay rate to 5. Convince yourself that the peak drug concentration does not go beyond 1, i.e. there is no build-up. Now set _dC = 0.1_. You'll now see a build up to a concentration of almost 9.

Now set drug decay rate back to _dC = 1_ and change treatment interval to 3 days. Run simulation and convince yourself that the drug concentration does again not really go above the administered dose of 1. Re-do for a decay rate of _dC = 0.1_. You'll see some drug build-up, but less. You can keep exploring how dose, decay rate of drug and time between treatment impact the curve you see for _C_. The impact of each of those components should be fairly easy to understand, but it's still worth playing with it a bit."

"DSAIRM_pkpdmodel"	"pkpdmodel"	"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics"	4	"Now we'll explore the PD part of the model, i.e. the equation _e = ..._ which describes the impact of the drug for a given drug concentration. Reset all inputs. Start treatment at day 2. Run the model for _Emax = 0_, you should get the same values as in task 1. Now explore _Emax_. Set it to 0.5, then 1. You should see a substantial increase in the impact of the drug, evidenced by higher uninfected number of cells remaining. You might habe noticed that by increasing Emax, the infection is delayed, which is especially noticable for _Emax = 1_. To account for this, set the simulation time to 100 days, then run again for the 3 different _Emax_ levels (0, 0.5, 1). You'll still find that an increased drug efficacy leads to fewer infected cells. Note that for the way we set up the model, the highest biologically reasonable value for _Emax_ is 1, which means _e = 1_. While you can stick higher values into the model, they don't make any sense (you'll be getting negative virus production). Depending on how the model is formulated, _Emax_ values above 1 could be possible.

Next explore the parameter k by running the simulation for values of 1,2 and 3. Leave everything else as it is (i.e. _Emax = 1_, _tfinal = 100_). You'll find that it doesn't have much of an impact on the infection. Finally, we'll explore the C50 parameter. Set k back to 1, run the model for C50 values of 1, 0.1 and 10. You'll notice that this parameter has a strong impact.

Run the model, take a look at the remaining number of uninfected cells. Assume your goal was to prevent as many uninfected cells from getting infected as possible. For that purpose, would you want to try and double the half-life of the drug (i.e. reduce decay rate by a factor of 2) or to reduce the concentration at which the drug has 50% action by half? Test both scenarios. You should find that the for both changes, the number of uninfected cells is somewhat above 90K, and reducing the C50 value is slightly better (this of course depends on other model parameters, you can try to find a set of combinations of the other parameters at which the impact of these two hypothetical drug improvements switches).

Reset all inputs, then set birth rate and death rate of uninfected cells to 10000 and 0.1. Run simulation for 100 days. You should get a steady state. Now turn on drug with _Emax = 1_, treatment start at day 50, and a drug that's given weekly at a dose of 1. Run the simulation. You should see that once the drug is administered, the system is knocked out of its steady state, and settles back to another state. This is not a steady state, but instead a repeating patter of virus increase and decrease. Make sure you understand why (take a look at the drug PK, you might need a log plot for that).
