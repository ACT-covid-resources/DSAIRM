"DSAIRM_fitconfint"	"fitconfint"	"Confidence Intervals"	1	"Since bootstrapping involves sampling, different random number seeds will lead to different results. Try by running the simulation for 2 different seeds. Note that the best fit value does not change. This could either be because we let the solver run long enough to find the best fit (not the case here), or because the underlying solver is deterministic. The latter is the case here. Some optimizers have a random component, then setting a seed for them is also important."	"T1R1"	"Something"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
"DSAIRM_fitconfint"	"fitconfint"	"Confidence Intervals"	2	"If the speed of your computer allows, increase the number of bootstrap samples to 10 or 50 or more. Re-run with different random number seeds. As you get more samples, the impact of the random sampling should diminish and eventually the results should be robust enough that you get essentially the same confidence intervals independent of random number seed."	"T2R1"	"Something"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
"DSAIRM_fitconfint"	"fitconfint"	"Confidence Intervals"	3	"Repeat the tasks above and explore how fitting the parameters in log space vs. linear space changes things. In theory, you should get the same results, since the underlying problem is the same. However, sometimes changing this scale can change the performance of the underlying solver. If we waited until the solver converged (found the best optimal solution), the result should be the same, but the time to get there might different. Here, since we only take a few iteration steps, the actual result might change."	"T3R1"	"Something"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
"DSAIRM_fitconfint"	"fitconfint"	"Confidence Intervals"	4	"Explore the above tasks and see how results change if you increase the number of iterations to whatever runs reasonably fast on your computer. Note that the time it takes to run the code scales with the product of the iterations and number of bootstraps, so if you set both high, things will get really slow."
