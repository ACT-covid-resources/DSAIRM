##Overview {#shinytab1}
This app allows exploration of the concept of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. 
For this purpose, we use the basic bacteria infection model introduced in the app of that name. If you haven't done so yet, familiarize yourself and work through that app first.


##The Model {#shinytab2}

###Model Overview
The model is the continous time model in the 'basic bacteria model' app. See the documentation there for the model description. For convenience, here is a quick summary and the equations again.

We model 2 compartments:

* **B** - bacteria 
* **I** - immune response

We specify the following processes/flows: 

1. Bacteria grow/divide at some maximum rate (which we label _g_) and saturate as they approach some maximum carrying capacity, _B~max~_. 
2. Bacteria die at a natural death rate (which we label _d~B~_).
3. Bacteria are killed by the immune response at some rate _k_.
4. The immune response grows proportional to the number of bacteria and itself at some rate _r_.
5. The immune response decays at some rate (which we label _d~I~_).

The equations are given by:

$$\dot B = g B (1-\frac{B}{B_{max}}) - d_B B - k BI$$
$$\dot I = r B I - d_I I$$


###Uncertainty and Sensitivity analysis
Often, for a given system we want to model, we only have rough estimates for the model parameters and starting values. Instead of specifying fixed values (which results in a single time-series), we can instead specify parameter ranges, choose sets of parameter values from these ranges, and run the model for multiple sets of parameters. 

The simplest way of specifying parameter ranges is to set an upper and lower bound (based on what we know about the biology of the system) and randomly choose any value within those bounds. We can almost always set bounds even if we know very little about a system. Assume we want to model the death rate of some cell type (e.g. NK cells) in humans. We might not know anything, but we can still be fairly confident that their lifespan is at least 1 second and less than 100 years. That's of course a wide range and we should and usually can narrow ranges further, based on biological knowledge of a given system.

If we are fairly certain that values are close to some quantity, instead of specifying a uniform distribution, we can choose one that is more peaked around the most likely value. Normal distributions are not ideal since they allow negative values, which doesn't make sense for our parameters. The gamma distribution is a better idea, since it leads to only positive values.

To run the model for this app, we need to specify values for the 2 initial conditions, _B~0~_ and _I~0~_, and the 6 model parameters _g_, _B~max~_, _d~B~_, _k_, _r_, _d~I~_. All initial conditions and parameters are sampled uniformly between the specified upper and lower bound, apart from the bacteria growth rate, which is given by a gamma distribution, with user-specified mean and variance. For this teaching app, there is no biological reason for making bacterial growth different, I just picked one parameter and decided to make it non-uniformly distributed to show you different ways one can implement distributions from which to draw parameter samples.

The way the samples are drawn could be done completely randomly, but that would lead to inefficient sampling. A smarter method exists, known as Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS). It essentially ensures that we sample the full range of possible parameter combinations in an efficient manner. For more technical details, see [@]. For this app, we use LHS.

Once we specify the ranges for each parameter, the sampling method, and the number of samples, the simulation draws that many samples, runs the model for each sample, and records outcomes of interest. While the underlying simulation returns a time-series for each sample, we are usually not interested in the full time-series. Instead, we are interested in some summary quantity. For instance in this model, we might be interested in the maximum/peak level of bacteria during the infection, the level of bacteria at the end (the steady state) of the infection, and the level of the immune response at steady state. This app records and reports those 3 quantities as _B~peak~_, _B~steady~_ and _I~steady~_.

Results from such simulations for multiple samples can be analyzed in different ways. The most basic one, called *uncertainty analysis* only asks what level of uncertainty we have in our outcomes of interest, given the amount of uncertainty in our model parameter values. This can be graphically represented with a boxplot, and is one of the plot options for this app.

In a next step, we can ask 'how sensitive is the outcome(s) of interest to variation in specific parameters' - that part is the *sensitivity analysis*. When you run the simulations, you essentially do both uncertainty and sensitivity analysis at the same time, it's just a question of how you further process the results. We can graphically insoect the relation between outcome and some parameter with scatterplots. If we find that there is a monotone up or down (or neither) trend between parameter and outcome, we can also summarize the finding using a correlation coefficient. For this type of analysis, using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is useful, which is what the app produces below the figures.

###A note on randomness in computer simulations
This simulation (as well as some of the others) involves sampling. This leads to some level of randomness. In science, we want to be as reproducible as possible. Fortunately, random numbers on a computer are not completely random, but can be reproduced. In practice, this is done by specifing a random number seed, in essence a starting position for the algorithm to produce pseudo-random numbers. As long as the seed is the same, the code should produce the same pseudo-random numbers each time, thus ensuring reproducibility.


##What to do {#shinytab3}

First, familiarize yourself with the setup of the app, it looks different from most others. Parameters are not set to specific values. Instead, most parameters have a lower and upper bound. For each simulation that is run, random values for the parameter are chosen  uniformly between those bounds. The parameter _g_ does not have a uniform but instead a gamma distribution, you can specify its mean and variance to determine the distribution from which values are sampled. 

The default outcome plots are boxplots, which show the distribution of the 3 outcomes of interest, given the different parameter samples. You can set the number of samples you want to run. Samples are constructed using the latin hypercube method to efficiently span the space of possible parameter values. In general, more samples are better, but of course take longer to run.

GO THROUGH TASKS AGAIN AND CHECK SINCE DEFAULTS HAVE CHANGED

###Task 1: 
* Leave all settings as they are, run 20 samples twice with the same random number seed, check to make sure you get exactly the same result twice.
* Now change the random number seed to a different value, run again. You should see results changed. (It doesn't matter if you change the seed by just a bit or a lot.)
* The more samples you have, the more robust the results are to changes in the underlying sample generation (determined by the random number seed). Try checking this by running 10 samples with 2 different random number seeds, then running 100+ samples with 2 different seeds. You should see less variability in the central quantities (mean, median) the larger your sample size.

Note that each sample means one simulation of the underlying dynamical model, so as sample numbers increase, things slow down.

###Task 2: 
* Recall the model and its behavior. If you can't, revisit the "Basic Bacteria" app and go through it. Use your understanding of the model to predict what happens if you increase both lower and upper bound for the immune response activation rate, _r_. 
* Increase lower/upper bounds by a factor of 10, from 10^-4^/10^-3^ to 10^-3^/10^-2^. Run simulations, see how results change.
* Now go the opposite, lower the lower/upper bounds by a factor of 10 to from 10^-5^/10^-4^. Run simulations, see how results change.
* Notice the 'system might not have reached steady state' message. If for too many of the samples steady state has not been reached, the results for _B~steady~_ and _I~steady~_ are not correct. In that case you need to increase the simulation time to allow the system to settle into steady state. For some parameter combinations, that can take very long. 

###Task 3: 
* Now let's explore what happens if we change ranges for the bacteria carrying capacity, _Bmax_. If we increase it, which of the outcomes do you expect to change, and in which direction?
* Test your assumption by increasing lower/upper bounds for _Bmax_ by a factor of 10. Keep all other parameters as before.

###Task 4: 
* Continue exploring by changing ranges for different parameters, see what you find. It is quite likely that for some parameters you'll get error messages. That generally means that the parameters for a given simulation are such that the differential equation solver can't properly run the model. That usually corresponds to biologically unrealistic parameter settings.


###Task 5: 
The above approach of exploring the impact of a parameter on results by varying bounds is tedious. Also, often we have bounds that are specified by biology, and not subject to us changing them. It would still be useful to know how a given parameter impacts the results. This is where sensitivity analysis comes in. We run the same simulations, but now instead of plotting outcomes as a boxplot, we produce scatterplots for outcomes as function of each varied parameter.

* Set values back as in task 1. If you can't remember, close the app and reopen.
* Swich the plot type from boxplot to scatterplot, run the simulation.
* Take a close look at the scatterplots to investigate the relation between different parameters and the various outcomes.

###Task 6: 
* Increase sample size to 100+ or whatever number runs within a few seconds on your computer. With more samples, the patterns of correlation are clearer in the plots.
* Look at the text below the plots. For each parameter-output pair, the code computes a rank correlation coefficient. Numbers close to 0 mean there is essentially no correlation, close to 1 or -1 means a large positive or negative correlation. (One could compute p-values for these correlations, but they are somewhat meaningless since the values will get smaller the more samples you use, so you can basically produce any p-value you want).

###Task 7: 
Since our model is rather simple, we can actually determine relations between parameters and some of the outcomes analytically. Specifically, it is possible to compute the steady state values for _B_ and _I_, _B~steady~_ and _I~steady~_. If you don't know what steady states are and how to compute them, go through the "Bacterium Model Exploration" app, where this is explained.

* If you haven't done yet or can't remember the equations for the steady states, compute them. You should find that $B_{steady} = d_I / r$ and a similar equation for $I_{steady}$. 
* Compare the scatterplots and correlation coefficients with the results from these equations. For instance based on the equation, you should see a linear correlation between _B~steady~ and _d~I~_. 
* You might find that there is a lot of scatter in the data, too much to see clear patterns. One could always increase sample size which should help detect patterns, but it takes longer to run. Another option is to restrict the variability to a subset of parameters. For instance if you set  lower bound = upper bound for the initial conditions, you remove any variability due to those parameters. Try to see if a mix of restricting some parameters and increasing sample size will give you clear patterns for the parameters.
