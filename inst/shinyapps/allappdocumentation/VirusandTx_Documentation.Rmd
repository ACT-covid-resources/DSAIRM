##Overview {#shinytab1}
This app allows exploration of a basic virus infection model in the presence of a drug. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab. Learn more about the model and its origins in the "Further Information" tab.


##The Model {#shinytab2}

###Model Overview
This model is a variation of the 'Basic Virus" model. Details on that model can be found in the corresponding app. The model has changed some to include drug treatment. 
###Model Diagram
The diagram illustrating this compartmental model is shown in the figure.

knitr::include_graphics("../media/hcvifndiagram.png")
```


###Model Equations
Implementing this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model leads to the following set of ordinary differential equations. 

$$\dot U = n - dU - (1-f)bUV$$ 
$$\dot I = (1-f)bUV - d_I I$$
$$\dot V = (1-e)pI - d_V V - gbUV$$

###Drug treatment modeling
This model differs from the basic virus model in the following ways:

* The drug can reduce infection of uninfected cells at a strength/efficacy given by _f_. This value is between 0 (completely ineffective) and 1 (100% effective).
* The drug can reduce production of progeny virus at a strength/efficacy given by _e_. This value is between 0 (completely ineffective) and 1 (100% effective).

Note that the drug is not explicitly modeled here (i.e. it is not given its own compartment/equation). Instead, we model the drug by its effects on some of the model parameters, and assume that this effect is either absent or present but does not otherwise change with time. The "Pharmacokinetics and pharacodynamics" app provides a model that includes explicit modeling of drug uptake and decay.


##What to do {#shinytab3}

###Task 1: 
For the first few tasks, we consider an acute viral infection and treatment (e.g. influenza and neuraminidase inhibitor drugs). The model is assumed to run in units of days.

* Set number of uninfected cells to 10^5^, 10 virions, no infected cells.
* We make the assumption that on the timescale of an acute infection (several days), the processes of natural, uninfected cell turnover are so slow that they can be ignored. Set values for the uninfected cell birth and death rates to reflect this assumption. 
* Assume that infected cells have an average lifespan of 1 day, virus of 12 hours.
* Set virus production rate to 10, infection rate to 10^-5^ and conversion factor to 1. 
* Set simulation time to 20 days, both drug effects to 0, 'start at steady state' should be set to 'no'. 
* Run the simulation. You should get a 28694 infected cells at the peak.
* Just for fun, set 'start at steady state' to 'yes', think about your expectations, run simulation and ensure your expectation and result agree.

###Task 2: 
* Set 'start at steady state' back to 'no'. 
* Assume treatment starts at day 10 and it works through reduction of cell infection. Try different values for _f_ (between 0 and 1) and see how results change. 
* Repeat the same, now assuming that the drug works through reduction of virus production.
* Repeat those steps assuming treatment starts at day 7. Then do it again with treatment start on day 5.

###Task 3: 
* If you knew the drug would be administered at day 4 and it reduced infection of cells by 50%, what do you predict the maximum number of infected cells would be?
* Use the model to predict if it would be better to design a drug that either reduces cell infection by 50% or virus production by 50% (and that drug was given on day 4)
* Use the model to predict if it would be better to double drug efficacy for reducing virus production from 40% to 80%, or decide to give drug on day 2 instead of day 4.
* Can you find a scenario (i.e. values for the different model parameters) in which giving drug at day 2 instead of day 4 beats the 40% vs 80% approach?


###Task 4: 
For the next few tasks, we consider a chronic viral infection and treatment (e.g. HCV or HIV). The model is assumed to run in units of days.

* Set all parameters as in task 1, but now allow for uninfected cell births (10000 per day) and cell death (rate of 0.001)
* Run the simulation for 100 days. You should reach a steady state with 44900 virions present.
* Set set 'start at steady state' to 'yes', confirm that all your variables stay at the steady state level they reached in the previous setting.

If you need an introduction or refresher on what the steady state means and how one could compute it, see the "Basic Virus" app.

###Task 5: 
A model like this has been applied to study the interferon treatment for Hepatitis C Virus [@neumann98]. (Today's standard of care for HCV does not involve interferon anymore, but it is still a useful example to consider). One question the investigators wanted to know is if one of the 2 mechanisms, i.e. reduction of cell infecton (parameter _f_) or reduction of virus production (parameter _e_) is better at explaining/predicting observed viral kinetics.

* Set the infected cell lifespan to 5 days, virus production rate to 100, virus lifespan to 4 hours, 10^7^ uninfected cells, infection rate 10^-7^, no treatment. Run simulation for 400 days with and without starting at steady state. Confirm that you end up with about 821667 virions at the end of the simulation.

###Task 5: 
* Now start at steady state, run the simulation for 20 days and turn on treatment at 10 days. Try different strengths of treatment efficacy (values for parameteres _f_ and _e_).
* If you learned that the observed viral load kinetics after treatment start was a fast decline followed by a slower decline, which of the 2 drug action mechanisms would you predict is more likely to happen? Or do you need both mechanisms present, or can neither reproduce a bi-phasic virus load decline? 

###Task 6: 


##Further Information {#shinytab4}
* For this app, the underlying script and function running the simulation is called `simulate_virus_tx.R`. Read the help file for the function to see how you can call it directly.
* For some examples of models that were used to study antivirals in acute infections, specifically influenza, see e.g. [@handel07; @beauchemin08jtb; @canini14].
* For some examples of models that were applied to antiviral treatment in chronic infections (HIV, HCV), see e.g. [@neumann98; @dixit04].
