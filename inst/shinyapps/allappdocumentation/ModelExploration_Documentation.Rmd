##Overview {#shinytab1}
This app allows you to explore the effect of specific model parameters on some outcomes of interest for the simple bacteria model. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab.


##The Model {#shinytab2}

###Model Overview
This is the same model as the one used for the 'Simple Bacteria Model' app. Check out and explore that app first. Here' we are only considering the continuous time, ordinary differential equation implementation of the model.

What's different here compared to the 'Simple Bacteria Model' app is that instead of running the simulation once for a given choice of parameter values and looking at the resulting time-series, this app lets you explore the impact of each model parameter on some outcomes. Specifically, we consider the maximum number of bacteria and immune response, and their values at the end of the simulation, when the system has settled down to a steady state (which assumes you run the simulation long enough). This corresponds biologically to a chronic infection condition.

In the app, those 4 outcomes of interest are labeled _Bppeak_, _Ipeak_, _Bsteady_ and _Isteady_. You can choose one of the model parameters to be varied between some minimum and maximum value. The other parameter values remain fixed. For each parameter value, the model is run and the 4 outcomes of interest computed. The resulting plot is one showing how those 4 outcomes of interest vary with the parameter you investigated.



###Model Diagram and equations
As mentioned, this is the same model as used in the 'Simple Bacteria Model' app. Go through that app and read the documentation to familiarize yourself with the model. For ease of reference, the flow diagram and the equations of the continuous model are shown again here:

```{r BIdiagram,  fig.cap='Flow diagram for simple bacteria infection model..',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../media/bacteriamodel.png")
```

$$\dot B = g(1-\frac{B}{B_{max}})-d_B B - k BI$$ 
$$\dot I = r B I - d_I I$$
