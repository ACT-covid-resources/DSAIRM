<h3>Model Description</h3>&#13;
<p>This model is a modification and extension of the model described in the “Model Stochasticity” app. Here, we track 2 types of virus, wild-type and drug sensitive, and a resistant mutant. We also consider the presence of a drug.</p>&#13;
<p>This model consists of 5 compartments:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><strong>U</strong> - uninfected cells</li>&#13;
<li><strong>I_s</strong> - cells infected with drug sensitive virus</li>&#13;
<li><strong>I_r</strong> - cells infected with drug resistant virus</li>&#13;
<li><strong>V_s</strong> - drug-sensitive virus</li>&#13;
<li><strong>V_r</strong> - drug-resistant virus</li>&#13;
</ul><p>For this model, we consider the following processes:</p>&#13;
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Drug-sensitive or drug resistant Virus infects uninfect cells at (the same) rate <em>b</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Drug-sensitive infected cells produce new drug-sensitive virus at rate <em>(1-m)p</em> and occasionally generate a resistant mutant virus at rate <em>mp</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Drug-resistant infected cells produce new drug-resistant virus at rate <em>(1-f)p</em>. The factor <em>f</em> accounts for the cost of fitness generally observed for drug resistant strains.</li>&#13;
<li>Sensitive and resistant virus are both removed at rate <em>dV</em>, loss of virus due to infecting new cells is ignored.</li>&#13;
<li>A drug reduces production of sensitive virus by a factor <em>e</em>, it does not affect resistant virus.</li>&#13;
</ol><p>For simplicity, we ignore the possibility that a cell might be infected by both drug sensitive and infected virus and might produce a mix of them.</p>&#13;

<h3>Model Equations</h3>&#13;
<p><em>If</em> we were to implement this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model, it would have the following set of ordinary differential equations.</p>&#13;
<p><span class="math display">\[\dot U =  - bUV_s - bU V_r\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot I_s = bUV_s - d_I I_s\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot I_r = bUV_r - d_I I_r\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot V_s = (1-e)(1-m)pI_s - d_V V_s\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot V_r = (1-e)mpI_s + (1-f)pI_r - d_V V_r\]</span></p>&#13;
<p><em>However</em> we use a stochastic model here. For such a model, the differential equation formulation is not valid. One can write down an equivalent formulation as a stochastic model by specifying every possible process (also called transition/event/reaction) that can occur and their propensities (the propensity multiplied with the time step gives the probability that a given process/event/transition occurs). For our model these are the following:</p>&#13;
<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Event type</th>&#13;
<th>Transitions</th>&#13;
<th>Propensity</th>&#13;
</tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>drug sensitive infection</td>&#13;
<td>U =&gt; U-1, I_s =&gt; I_s + 1</td>&#13;
<td>b<em>U</em>V_s</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="even"><td>drug resistant infection</td>&#13;
<td>U =&gt; U-1, I_r =&gt; I_r + 1</td>&#13;
<td>b<em>U</em>V_r</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="odd"><td>death if I_s</td>&#13;
<td>I_s =&gt; I_s - 1</td>&#13;
<td>dI*I_s</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="even"><td>death if I_r</td>&#13;
<td>I_r =&gt; I_r - 1</td>&#13;
<td>dI*I_r</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="odd"><td>production of V_s</td>&#13;
<td>V_s =&gt; V_s + 1</td>&#13;
<td>(1-e)<em>(1-m)</em>p*I_s</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="even"><td>removal of V_s</td>&#13;
<td>V_s =&gt; V_s - 1</td>&#13;
<td>dV*V_s</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="odd"><td>production of V_r</td>&#13;
<td>V_r =&gt; V_r + 1</td>&#13;
<td>(1-e)<em>m</em>p<em>I_s + (1-f)</em>p*I_r</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="even"><td>removal of V_r</td>&#13;
<td>V_r =&gt; V_r - 1</td>&#13;
<td>dV*V_r</td>&#13;
</tr></tbody></table></div>&#13;
