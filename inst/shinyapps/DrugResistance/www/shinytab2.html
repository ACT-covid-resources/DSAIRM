<h3>Model Equations</h3>&#13;
<p><em>If</em> we were to implement this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model, it would have the following set of ordinary differential equations.</p>&#13;
<p><em>However</em> we use a stochastic model here. For such a model, the differential equation formulation is not valid. One can write down an equivalent formulation as a stochastic model by specifying every possible process (also called transition/event/reaction) that can occur and their propensities (the propensity multiplied with the time step gives the probability that a given process/event/transition occurs). For our model these are the following:</p>&#13;
<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Event type</th>&#13;
<th>Transitions</th>&#13;
<th>Propensity</th>&#13;
</tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Production of U</td>&#13;
<td>U =&gt; U+1</td>&#13;
<td>n*U</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="even"><td>death/removal of U</td>&#13;
<td>U =&gt; U-1</td>&#13;
<td>dU*U</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="odd"><td>infection</td>&#13;
<td>U =&gt; U-1, V =&gt; V-1, I =&gt; I+1</td>&#13;
<td>b<em>U</em>V</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="even"><td>death if I</td>&#13;
<td>I =&gt; I-1</td>&#13;
<td>dI*I</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="odd"><td>production of V</td>&#13;
<td>V =&gt; V+1</td>&#13;
<td>p*I</td>&#13;
</tr><tr class="even"><td>removal of V</td>&#13;
<td>V =&gt; V-1</td>&#13;
<td>dV*V</td>&#13;
</tr></tbody></table></div>&#13;
