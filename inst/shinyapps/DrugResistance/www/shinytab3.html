<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p>Note: For this simulation, you can set a random number seed. This ensures reproducibility. If you choose the same seed and run the simulation twice, the same random numbers are generated and you get the same trajectory. To get different results, you can change the random number seed. This is NOT a model parameter, just something that controls the randomness during the simulations.</p>&#13;

<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Confirm that you get a single infection with sensitive virus with the default settings.</li>&#13;
<li>Set ‘resistant generation fraction’ to a small on-zero value. You should start seeing some resistant virus. Why is it it lower than the sensitive virus?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set ‘resistant generation fraction’ to 0.01. Run simulation for different drug efficacy values. Observe how the magnitude of the <em>V<sub>s</sub></em> and <em>V<sub>r</sub></em> curves change and eventually for high enough drug efficacy, not infection takes place anymore.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set drug efficacy to 0.4, everything else as before.</li>&#13;
<li>Run simulation for different values of resistant fitness cost. Observe how the magnitude of the <em>V<sub>s</sub></em> and <em>V<sub>r</sub></em> curves change.</li>&#13;
<li>Explore how different values for drug efficacy (which affects <em>V<sub>s</sub></em>) and fitness cost (which affects <em>V<sub>r</sub></em>) lead to different outcomes.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Repeat or continue your explorations with more than one stochastic simulation being run.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
