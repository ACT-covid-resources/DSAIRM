<h2>Further Information</h2>&#13;
<ul><li>This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.</li>&#13;
<li>For this app, the underlying functions running the simulations are called <code>simulate_basicbacteria.R</code> and <code>simulate_basicbacteria_discrete.R</code>. You can call these functions directly, without going through the shiny app. Type <code>?simulate_basicbacteria</code> or <code>?simulate_basicbacteria_discrete</code> into the R console for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You could also modify this R function for your own purposes - though that requires R coding knowledge.</li>&#13;
<li>The model we are exploring here belongs to a class of well-studied models in ecology known as predator-prey models. If you want to learn more about these kinds of models, see e.g. [REFS]. The models in those references are described in the context of ecology, but results transfer to within-host situation.</li>&#13;
