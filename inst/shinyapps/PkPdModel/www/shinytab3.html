<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><em>The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of days (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse days). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first (e.g. if it says a week, you need to convert it to 7 days).</em></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the initial conditions to 10<sup>5</sup> uninfected cells, no infected cells and 10 virus particles.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that uninfected cells do not die, infected cells have a life-span of 1 day, and virus has a life-span of 6 hours.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that there are no uninfected cells produced/born, that the virus production by an infected cell is 100 virions per day and that the rate at which new cells become infected is 10<sup>-6</sup>.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume there is no need to do any unit adjustment/conversion (i.e. the value of that parameter is 1).</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation for 50 days, produce plots with and without log-scales.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>You should get a single, acute infection with virus and infected cells rising and declining. At the end you should be left with around 11068 uninfected cells (and no infected cells and virus).</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Slowly increase the virus death rate. Contemplate what you expect to see, then run the simulation to compare. Keep increasing until you get essentially no more infection. You will have to adjust the simulation time for that, too.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the virus death rate back to what it was in task 1. Now change the virus production rate until you reach the value at which the virus does not cause any infection.</li>&#13;
<li>You can also repeat this process for the infected cell death rate and the infection rate.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<p>A well-studied quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the basic reproductive number (R_0_), which determines if a pathogen can cause an outbreak at the population level. An equivalent R_0_ can be defined for a within-host model to determine if you get an infection or not. For this virus model (with no births and deaths of uninfected cells), R_0_ = b<em>p</em>V_0_/(dV*dI).</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Given this equation for R_0_ and the simulations you performed in the previous tasks, figure out what the threshold value for R_0_ is below which no infection occurs.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>To learn more about R_0_, see e.g. <span class="citation">(Heffernan, Smith, and Wahl 2005; Roberts 2007; C. A. A. Beauchemin et al. 2008)</span>. Some of those references describe R_0_ in the context of infectious disease epidemiology, but if you replace humans/hosts with cells, the same concepts apply at the within-host level.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<p>Without birth/production of new uninfected cells, the most you can get is a single acute infection (or no infection at all). To convince yourself that it’s impossible to produce a chronic infection, play around with the model.</p>&#13;
<p>Production of new uninfected cells is an example of <em>resource replenishment</em>. This is needed to allow a steady state/chronic infection, and this concept applies in general (e.g. on the population level, new susceptible individuals need to be created either through birth or through losing immunity).</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s explore the model with uninfected cell prodution.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>We start by focusing on the dynamics of uninfected cells only. To that end, set the number of initial infected cells and virus particles to 0. Keep the number of uninfected cells at 10<sup>5</sup>, set birth and death of uninfected cells to zero.</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation. Nothing should happen, uninfected cells should stay at their starting value.</li>&#13;
<li>Now play around with birth rate and death rate of uninfected cells and see how that affects the dynamics.</li>&#13;
<li>The number of uninfected cells once the system has settled down only depends on the birth and death rate, not the starting conditions. Confirm this by trying different values for U_0_ while keeping birth and death rate at some fixed values.</li>&#13;
<li>One can write down an equation for uninfected cells at steady state as a function of birth and death rate, i.e. U_s_ = f(n,dU), where f() is the mathematical symbol for “some function”. In this case, it is a very simple function. Based on your explorations of different values for birth and death rate and the resulting values of U_s_, figure out this equation.</li>&#13;
<li>To test your equation, set birth rate to 20000, set initial condition for uninfected cells to 10<sup>5</sup> and set death rate such that the number of uninfected cells does not change.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<p>Now we’ll explore an infection in the presence of uninfected cell birth and death.</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Set all parameters as in task 1.</li>&#13;
<li>Set birth and death as described at the end of the previous task.</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation. You should get an initial large increase in virus load, which then settles down and reaches a steady state of around 295000.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-8" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 8:</h3>&#13;
<p>Repeat the explorations you did above for the parameters <em>b</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>dV</em> and <em>dI</em> and investigate how the steady state values for <em>U</em>, <em>I</em> and <em>V</em> depend on those parameters. You might need to increase the simulation time to ensure the system has settled down.</p>&#13;
<p>Once the system has settled down, there are no more changes in the numbers for each compartment. Mathematically, that means that the left side of the differential equations becomes 0, and they turn into the following algebraic equations: <span class="math inline">\(0 = n - dU - bUV\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 = bUV - d_I I\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 = pI - d_V V - gb UV\)</span>. One can solve those equations for each of the compartments to get a mathematical expression of what <em>U</em>, <em>I</em> and <em>V</em> are at steady state. Try to do this. You should find that <span class="math inline">\(U_s_ = dI*dV/(b*p)\)</span> and similar equations for <span class="math inline">\(I_s_\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_s\)</span>.</p>&#13;
<p>Check that your equations agree with the simulations. Plug the values for the parameters into each of the equations and see if that value is the same as you get as steady state value from the simulation. If that’s not the case, it means your equations aren’t right yet.</p>&#13;
<p>It is useful to note that while the total numbers for each variable do not change at steady state, this is a dynamic equilibrium. There are still constantly cells and virus being produced and destroyed, it just so happens that the production and destruction mechanisms are equally strong and thus the overall numbers do not change.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-9" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 9:</h3>&#13;
<p>Continue to explore the model. Even though it’s a fairly simple model, you can get interesting dynamics from it, such as acute infections and chronic infections. Contemplate what specific pathogens this model could represent. Also note that you can get all this dynamics without any immune response present. The interaction between cells and virus are enough to produce patterns of infection dynamics that broadly agree with patterns we can see for real infections. This of course does not mean the immune response is not important. But it does illustrate that if all we have is virus kinetics data (that is likely very noisy), we are likely able to capture that dynamics with many different types of models, incuding a simple one like this that is likely not too realistic for any given pathogen.</p>&#13;
