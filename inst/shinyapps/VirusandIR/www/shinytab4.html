<ul><li>For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called <code>simulate_virusandIR.R</code>. You can call these functions directly, without going through the shiny app. Look at the help file for the function to learn how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You could also modify this R function for your own purposes - though that requires R coding knowledge.</li>&#13;
<li>An example of a model similar to the above applied to influenza, see e.g. <span class="citation">(Handel, Longini, and Antia 2010)</span>.</li>&#13;
