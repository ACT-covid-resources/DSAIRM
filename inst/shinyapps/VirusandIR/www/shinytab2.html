<h3>Model Overview</h3>&#13;
<p>This model consists of several compartments that capture some of the basic dynamics of virus and immune response during an infection. In this model, we track the following entities, by assigning each to a compartment:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><strong>U</strong> - uninfected cells</li>&#13;
<li><strong>I</strong> - infected cells</li>&#13;
<li><strong>V</strong> - (free) virus</li>&#13;
<li><strong>F</strong> - innate immune response</li>&#13;
<li><strong>T</strong> - CD8 T-cells</li>&#13;
<li><strong>B</strong> - B-cells</li>&#13;
<li><strong>A</strong> - Antibodies</li>&#13;
</ul><p>In addition to specifying the <em>compartments</em> of a model, we need to specify the dynamics determining the changes for each compartment. Broadly speaking, there are processes that increase the numbers in a given compartment/stage, and processes that lead to a reduction. Those processes are sometimes called in-flows and out-flows.</p>&#13;
<p>For our system, we specify the following processes/flows:</p>&#13;
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Uninfected cells are produced at some rate <em>n</em> and naturally die at some rate <em>dU</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Virus infects cells at rate <em>b</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Infected cells produce new virus at rate <em>p</em> and die at rate <em>dI</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Free virus is removed at rate <em>dV</em> or goes on to infect further uninfected cells.</li>&#13;

<h3>Model Equations</h3>&#13;
<p>Implementing this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model leads to the following set of ordinary differential equations.</p>&#13;
<p><span class="math display">\[\dot U = n - dU - bUV\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot I = bUV - d_I I\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot V = pI - d_V V - gb UV\]</span></p>&#13;
