<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>When you start the app, by default the deterministic model is run and you should see an infection happening. Switch to the stochastic model with the same parameter settings and run the model. You should not see an outbreak.</li>&#13;
<li>Change the random number seed and find a value for which you do get an outbreak.</li>&#13;
<li>Set “Models to run” to both. You should get infections from each model. Compare how they differ.</li>&#13;
<li>Increase the number of simulations (for the stochastic model) to 10, then 20. Look at the results, try to understand what you see.</li>&#13;
<li>Try the previous 2 steps for seveal different random number seeds.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Turn off the deterministic model.</li>&#13;
<li>Run the stochastic model with 5 simulations for different random seeds. See how the maximum number of infected cells changes.</li>&#13;
<li>Now repeat for 50 stochastic simulations. You should see less variation now since you average over more simulations. The more simulations, the more robust the results are (but it takes longer to run). Ideally, you’d like to always be in a setting where arbitrary choices, such as the initial random number seed, do not (or only negligibly) influence your results.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Turn the deterministic model back on, run 50 stochastic simulations. Notice that the deterministic model is not ‘the average’ of the stochastic simulations. It is true that for <em>linear</em> models, the mean of many stochastic models is described by the deterministic model. But that is not true for <em>nonlinear</em> models like the one we have here. It’s an important point to keep in mind if you build models and try both a deterministic and stochastic one. You don’t necessarily get the same results, even if you average over many stochastic model runs.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Turn off the deterministic model, keep all parameter values as before (if you changed them, exit the app and reload). Set number of simulations to 2, random number seed to 100.</li>&#13;
<li>Run simulation. You should see 2 stochastic model runs, one where you get an infection and one where you don’t.</li>&#13;
<li>Look at the min/max/final values reported. Then do 4 stochastic runs, look at min/max/final values again.</li>&#13;
<li>From that, what do you conclude about how the mean is calculated? What other way of reporting it might be a reasonable alternative?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Currently, stochasticity/randomness is a determining factor for the take-off or not of an infection. Once an infection has started, the resulting time-series look fairly smooth and not too noisy. Play around with the model parameters to try and find a regime where the whole infection dynamics looks stochastic/noisy.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>In doing the last task, you likely figured out that for small numbers, you get more noisy results. Set the number of uninfected cells to 100 and the infection rate to 10<sup>-2</sup>. Run several stochastic outbreaks. You should see fairly random virus and infected cell plots.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>The important take-home message from this is that for small numbers (e.g. at the start or end of an infection, or when overall numbers are large), stochasticity is often important. Once numbers are fairly large (100s or more), then deterministic models are usually doing a fairly good job describing the system dynamics. (Law of large numbers.)</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep exploring. For instance investigate chronic/steady state conditions (with uninfected cell birth/death turned on) and see how they might or might not differ between the deterministic and (average) stochastic simulations.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
