<h2>Overview</h2>&#13;
<p>This app allows exploration of a stochastic model that is almost identical to the deterministic basic virus infection model. In fact, both models are being run so comparison is possible. Read about the model in the “Model” tab. Then do the tasks described in the “What to do” tab.</p>&#13;
