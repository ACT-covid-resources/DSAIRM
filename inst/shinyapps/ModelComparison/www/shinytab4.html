<ul><li>For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called <code>simulate_basicfitting.R</code>. You can call this function directly, without going through the shiny app. Type <code>?simulate_basicfitting</code> into the R console for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You could also modify this R function for your own purposes - though that requires R coding knowledge.</li>&#13;
<li>If you want to learn a bit more about fitting these kinds of models, see e.g. [].</li>&#13;
