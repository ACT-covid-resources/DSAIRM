<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p>First, familiarize yourself with the setup of the app, it looks different from most others. Parameters are not set to specific values. Instead, most parameters have a lower and upper bound. For each simulation that is run, random values for the parameter are chosen uniformly between those bounds. The parameter <em>g</em> does not have a uniform but instead a gamma distribution, you can specify its mean and variance to determine the distribution from which values are sampled.</p>&#13;
<p>The default outcome plots are boxplots, which show the distribution of the 3 outcomes of interest, given the different parameter samples. You can set the number of samples you want to run. Samples are constructed using the latin hypercube method to efficiently span the space of possible parameter values. In general, more samples are better, but of course take longer to run.</p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Leave all settings as they are, run 20 samples twice with the same random number seed, check to make sure you get exactly the same result twice.</li>&#13;
<li>Now change the random number seed to a different value, run again. You should see results changed. (It doesn’t matter if you change the seed by just a bit or a lot.)</li>&#13;
<li>The more samples you have, the more robust the results are to changes in the underlying sample generation (determined by the random number seed). Try checking this by running 10 samples with 2 different random number seeds, then running 100+ samples with 2 different seeds. You should see less variability in the central quantities (mean, median) the larger your sample size.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Note that each sample means one simulation of the underlying dynamical model, so as sample numbers increase, things slow down.</p>&#13;

<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Recall the model and its behavior. If you can’t, revisit the “Basic Bacteria” app and go through it. Use your understanding of the model to predict what happens if you increase both lower and upper bound for the immune response activation rate, <em>r</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Increase lower/upper bounds by a factor of 10, from 10<sup>-4</sup>/10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-3</sup>/10<sup>-2</sup>. Run simulations, see how results change.</li>&#13;
<li>Now go the opposite, lower the lower/upper bounds by a factor of 10 to from 10<sup>-5</sup>/10<sup>-4</sup>. Run simulations, see how results change.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now let’s explore what happens if we change ranges for the bacteria carrying capacity, <em>Bmax</em>. If we increase it, which of the outcomes do you expect to change, and in which direction?</li>&#13;
<li>Test your assumption by increasing lower/upper bounds for <em>Bmax</em> by a factor of 10. Keep all other parameters as before.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Continue exploring by changing ranges for different parameters, see what you find. It is quite likely that for some parameters you’ll get error messages. That generally means that the parameters for a given simulation are such that the differential equation solver can’t properly run the model. That usually corresponds to biologically unrealistic parameter settings.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<p>The above approach of exploring the impact of a parameter on results by varying bounds is tedious. Also, often we have bounds that are specified by biology, and not subject to us changing them. It would still be useful to know how a given parameter impacts the results. This is where sensitivity analysis comes in. We run the same simulations, but now instead of plotting outcomes as a boxplot, we produce scatterplots for outcomes as function of each varied parameter.</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Set values back as in task 1. If you can’t remember, close the app and reopen.</li>&#13;
<li>Swich the plot type from boxplot to scatterplot, run the simulation.</li>&#13;
<li>Take a close look at the scatterplots to investigate the relation between different parameters and the various outcomes.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Increase sample size to 100+ or whatever number runs within a few seconds on your computer. With more samples, the patterns of correlation are clearer in the plots.</li>&#13;
<li>Look at the text below the plots. For each parameter-output pair, the code computes a rank correlation coefficient. Numbers close to 0 mean there is essentially no correlation, close to 1 or -1 means a large positive or negative correlation. (One could compute p-values for these correlations, but they are somewhat meaningless since the values will get smaller the more samples you use, so you can basically produce any p-value you want).</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<p>Since our model is rather simple, we can actually determine relations between parameters and some of the outcomes analytically. Specifically, it is possible to compute the steady state values for <em>B</em> and <em>I</em>, <em>Bsteady</em> and <em>Isteady</em>. If you don’t know what steady states are and how to compute them, go through the “Bacterium Model Exploration” app, where this is explained.</p>&#13;
<ul><li>If you haven’t done yet or can’t remember the equations for the steady states, compute them. You should find that <span class="math inline">\(B_{steady} = d_I / r\)</span> and a similar equation for <span class="math inline">\(I_{steady}\)</span>.</li>&#13;
<li/>&#13;
