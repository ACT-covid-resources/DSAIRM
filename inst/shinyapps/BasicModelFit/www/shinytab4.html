<h2>Further Information</h2>&#13;
<ul><li>The code running the model fitting is in the function/script <code>simulate_fitbasicmodel.R</code>. This function repeatedly calls the underlying simulation model encoded in <code>simulate_basicvirus.R</code> during the fitting. Check the help file for both functions to see how to use them.</li>&#13;
<li>You can of course alter the underlying function to fit more parameters or a different model. That will require some time getting familiar with the code.</li>&#13;
<li>A good source for fitting models in <code>R</code> is <span class="citation">(Bolker 2008)</span>. Note though that the focus is on ecological data and ODE-type models are not/barely discussed.</li>&#13;
<li>This book <span class="citation">(Hilborn and Mangel 1997)</span> has nice explanations of data fitting, model comparison, etc. but is more theoretical.</li>&#13;
<li>Lot’s of good online material exists on fitting/inference. Most of the material is explained in the context of static, non-mechanistical, statistical or machine learning models, but a lot of the principles apply equally to ODEs.</li>&#13;
<li>A discussion of overfitting (also called ‘identifiability problem’) for ODEs is <span class="citation">(Miao et al. 2011)</span>.</li>&#13;
<li>Advanced functionality to fit stochastic models can be found in the <code>pomp</code> package in R. (If you don’t know what stochastic models are, check out the app by that name in DSAIRM.)</li>&#13;
