<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><em>The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of days (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse days).</em></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set initial bacteria and immune response to 100 and 10.</li>&#13;
<li>Set bacteria growth and death rate to 2 and 1. The former value does not matter since we’ll be exploring the simulation for different values of <em>g</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Set carrying capacity to 10<sup>5</sup>, IR kill rate and activation rate to 10<sup>-4</sup> and immune response death rate to 2.</li>&#13;
<li>Choose <em>g</em> as the parameter to vary, go from 2 to 10, do 10 different parameter values, linear spacing, and no log scales for plotting.</li>&#13;
<li>Set maximum simulation time to 100. Run simulation, check to ensure all simulations reach steady state (see output message below plot). Then reduce simulation time to 20 days, note how some simulations did not reach steady state and how that affects results.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Play around with the number of different parameter values (the higher the number, the more often the simulation runs and the longer it takes), the minimum and maximum, and if you want them linearly or logarithmically spaced and plotted.</li>&#13;
<li>Think a bit about the results you see in the plot for the different outcomes. Would you have expected that as the bacteria growth rate increases, the peak bacteria load increases? What about the fact that the peak and steady state immune response increases? And what about the steady state bacteria not increasing?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Take a look at the model equations and diagram and see if by ‘staring’ at them, you can understand why you got the results you saw in the last task.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>With enough practice, it is often possible to intuit specific results based on the underlying equations - but that requires a good bit of modeling practice. As models get more complicated, even experienced modelers can often not inutit what model behavior one should expect as specific parameters vary. Often the only way to find out is by actually running the simulations.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<p>The model we have here is so simple that we can in fact figure out two of the outcomes shown in the plot without having to run simulations but instead by doing some math. Specifically, we can compute the steady states for the bacteria and immune response variables. If you have done the basic virus tasks, you have encountered the steady state idea already. We repeat it here.</p>&#13;
<p>Once the system has settled down, there are no more changes in the numbers for each compartment. Mathematically, that means that the left side of the differential equations becomes 0, and they turn into the following algebraic equations: <span class="math inline">\(0 = g(1-\frac{B}{B_{max}})-d_B B - k BI\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0 = r B I - d_I I\)</span>. One can solve those equations for each of the compartments to get a mathematical expression of what <em>B</em> and <em>I</em> are at steady state. Try to do this. You should find that <span class="math inline">\(B_{steady} = d_I / r\)</span> and a similar equation for <span class="math inline">\(I_{steady}\)</span>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Compare the mathematical equations you found in the previous task with what you find in the plots. Things should be consistent, i.e. if the plot shows that <em>B<sub>steady</sub></em> does not depend on <em>g</em>, the mathematical equation should show the same. Similarly, since the plot shows that <em>I<sub>steady</sub></em> increases with <em>g</em>, that should be reflected in the mathematical equation for <em>I<sub>steady</sub></em> you got above.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>We cannot compute similar mathematical expressions for <em>B<sub>peak</sub></em> and <em>I<sub>peak</sub></em>. In general, as soon as our model reaches a certain level of complexity (maybe around 5 equations and more), getting analytic/mathematical equations for most outcomes of interest is not possible and the numerical approach of running the simulations and looking at the results is the only option we have.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Let’s explore the impact of a different parameter. Set all variables as in task 1.</li>&#13;
<li>Choose <em>d<sub>I</sub></em> as the parameter to vary and set lower and upper limit to 1 and 10.</li>&#13;
<li>Before you run the model, look at your equations for <em>B<sub>steady</sub></em> and <em>I<sub>steady</sub></em> and based on these, predict what you should see in the plot.</li>&#13;
<li>Similarly, look at the model equations and try to intuit what you might expect <em>B<sub>peak</sub></em> and <em>I<sub>peak</sub></em> to do as you increase <em>d<sub>I</sub></em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Now run the model, compare the results with your expectations. How do they agree or disagree?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>In the previous task, you should have noticed 2 different patterns of the outcomes for <em>d<sub>I</sub></em> less than 5 and greater than 5. Try to understand what happens (qualitatively) with your model in those 2 regimes and how that leads to the results you are seeing.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-8" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 8:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Do the same explorations you did above for any other parameter you want to investigate.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Note that here we focus on a single parameter at a time. With some coding effort, we could change the underlying simulation to loop over say 2 parameters and produce outcomes for sets of parameter values, e.g. <em>B<sub>peak</sub></em> as a function of <em>g</em> and <em>r</em>. The results could be plotted as a 2-dimensional heatmap. While this could be extended to more than 2 parameters, it will become hard to visualize and long to run. If there are many parameters that could change, a different approach is useful, which you’ll learn about in the Uncertainty and Sensitivity App.</p>&#13;
