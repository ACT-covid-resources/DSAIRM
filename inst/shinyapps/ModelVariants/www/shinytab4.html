<h2>Further Information</h2>&#13;
<ul><li>For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called <code>simulate_modelvariants.R</code>. You can call these functions directly, without going through the shiny app. Look at the help file for the function to learn how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You could also modify this R function for your own purposes - though that requires R coding knowledge.</li>&#13;
<li>Explorations of different models and their impacts on outcomes for acute virus infections in general can be found in e.g. <span class="citation">(Li and Handel 2014)</span> and a more detailed discussion of previously published models and comparison to data for influenza can be found in <span class="citation">(Dobrovolny et al. 2013)</span>.</li>&#13;
